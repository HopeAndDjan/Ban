This is a ban script which bans you from a game dont worry it doesnt actually BAN you it just kicks you from the game, how it works is you wait 5 seconds then you get "banned", you can modify this you can modify this the script will tell you!

```Lua

wait(5)

local banreason = "enter ban reason" <-- input your ban reason
game.Players.LocalPlayer:Kick(banreason)
